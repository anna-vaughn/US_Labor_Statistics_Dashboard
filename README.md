# US_Labor_Statistics_Dashboard
ECON 8320 Semester Project

Since two of the requirements include the total number of 
non-farm workers (series CES0000000001) and unemployment rates (series 
LNS14000000) I am planning on creating a dashboard focusing on the relationship 
between employment and the job market. I will do this by comparing the job openings rate 
(series JTS000000000000000JOR), hires rate (series JTS000000000000000HIR), quits rate 
(series JTS000000000000000QUR), and layoffs and discharges rate (series 
JTS000000000000000LDR) with unemployment rates. All of the data chosen will be the 
seasonally adjusted series to match the total number of non-farm workers and 
unemployment rates. I would like to create a dashboard that will explore the relationships 
between these variables using different visualizations and see what patterns exist, and the 
overall impact these rates have on the job market if any. I am planning to utilize a line chart 
to easily display information for comparison over time and I am also planning on showing 
the information on a map of the United States for comparison state-by-state. 
The dashboard will display all of the collected series data for the current month as the 
default, along the top of the page. The line graph and map visualizations will take up the 
majority of the dashboard and be displayed beneath the month overview data points. I am 
planning on making the dashboard interactive, so the viewer will have the ability to change 
which month is displayed. Additionally, the viewer can select which variables to display 
and filter on different months for comparison in the line and map visualizations. Both 
visualizations will be changed in tandem based on the viewer’s selections. When the 
viewer hovers or clicks on parts of the visualization the data points will be displayed. I also 
plan on allowing the viewer the ability to download the underlying visualization data based 
on their selections.
